The index.html is the homepage, which comprises a video background and two columns. One column contains the description of how the inside should look, while the other column has an embed of Google Maps showing the locations and times.

The products page is composed of six books, most of which I have read. The cards represent the books and have their own built-in carousel and accordion.

I didn't follow the MVP plan exactly because I was very ambitious and added more things as I went on. I also shifted my focus from the original idea to a bookstore.

I'm most proud of the cards on my products page and the container that has the embedded Google Maps.

I would have liked to add a parallax effect, but I didn't see much use for it, and it didn't really add anything to my website.
